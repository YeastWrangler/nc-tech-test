Please add any additional notes hereâ€¦

I experienced several issues with trying to run Jest and was getting this error message:

"Jest encountered an unexpected token

    This usually means that you are trying to import a file which Jest cannot parse, e.g. it's not plain JavaScript.

    By default, if Jest sees a Babel config, it will use that to transform your files, ignoring "node_modules"."

I did a work around to specifiy the files as modules but that then created issues with trying to require and export my functions.    

Unfortunately I spent more time then I would have liked trying to debug this issue so the amount of code I wrote was not very much. I believe I could be more productive with a different iteration of the challange.
